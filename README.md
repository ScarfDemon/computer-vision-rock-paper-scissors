## Training the model using Teachable-Machine
Using [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), four classes are made: Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Nothing. Each class is trained with images of me with the correct gesture (or no gesture for the Nothing class).

The model was then downloaded as a Tensorflow model as a folder containing the model as  *keras_model.h5*,  and labels *labels.txt*.
